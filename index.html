    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML is made up of:
      <ul>
        <li>Text content: what one see's</li>
        <li> Markup: What it looks like</li>
        <li>References: to other documents (example: images and videos)</li>
        <li> Links to other pages</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Markup's make text look different and is made up of <em> tags</em>. Such as the <em>name, bold and emphasis</em> tag.
        <p><em><h2>HTML ATTRIBUTES</h2></em></p>
        HTML attributes provide additional information about and element. An example used was the <em> anchor</em> tag. Example below:
        <br> I am going to love learning from <a href="udacity.com"> UDACITY</a>. Other tags can also be attributes such as the image tag.
        <p>
          <h2>WHITESPACE</h2></p>To have <em>whitespace</em> one can use the <em>
     br</em> tag which stands for break to force multiple lines and is also a void tag which means that it does not need a closing tag. To enter multiple line breaks use the <em> p</em> tag. Although, this tag is not a void tag
        <br> therefore, it needs a closing tag. The difference between these two tags are that the
        <em> p</em> tag is a block tag while <em> p</em> is inline.
        <br> Other block tags used are <em>div and form </em>. Inline used are <em> a, span, br, img</em>.
        <p>
          <h2> STUCTURE</h2></p>
        The stucture of the document must consits of the:
        <ul>
          <li>Doctype</li>
          <li>Opening tag</li>
          <li>Metadata (Head)</li>
          <li>Title</li>
          <li>Body (The content of the document)</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="adding-css-style"><p> Adding CSS Style to the HTML Structure</h1>
        <P>
          CSS is code written to control the <em>"style"</em> of the HTML element and allows programmers to avoid repetition.
          <br>There are different methods of adding CSS styling. One can write CSS in the <em>Head</em> of the HTML or add to the CSS file.
          <div id="box">
            <p>
              <h2>Box, Grids and Rules</h2></p>
            Everything on a page is acutually in a box. The header, imaages, name and title, etc. Boxes are defined with <em><b>div</em></b> tags.
          </div>
